# Design Patterns on Spring Boot

Demo project for Design Patterns on Spring Boot

## Dependencies
- Java 17
- Spring Boot 2.7
- JUnit 5

## Attention

Some examples may be didactic and not functional, and should not be used in real-world production projects. 

## 1. Strategy

Allows you to choose or interchange algorithms at runtime

[Source Code](/src/main/java/silas/yudi/design/patterns/strategy)
[Tests](/src/test/java/silas/yudi/design/patterns/strategy)

## 2. Template Method

Allows you to avoid code duplication and determine a skeleton of operations for a family of algorithms

[Source Code](/src/main/java/silas/yudi/design/patterns/templatemethod)
[Tests](/src/test/java/silas/yudi/design/patterns/templatemethod)

## 3. Facade

Allows you to encapsulate a complex subsystem behind a unique interface

[Source Code](/src/main/java/silas/yudi/design/patterns/facade)
[Tests](/src/test/java/silas/yudi/design/patterns/facade)

## 4. Abstract Factory

Allows you to create a family of related objects

[Source Code](/src/main/java/silas/yudi/design/patterns/abstractfactory)
[Tests](/src/test/java/silas/yudi/design/patterns/abstractfactory)
